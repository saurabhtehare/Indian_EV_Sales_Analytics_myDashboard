# Key Points:
🚀 Purpose: Analyze the Electric Vehicle (EV) market in India from 2001 to 2024. Highlight the most significant growth regions, trends, and key drivers to support investment and policy initiatives.

♻️ Data Source:  [Kaggel](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srinrealyf/india-ev-market-data) 

🔍Key Objectives:
 Identify trends in EV adoption and compare growth across vehicle categories. Highlight states and regions with the highest EV market penetration. Examine the impact of government policies on market growth.

Data Structure:
❕ Columns include State/UT, Year, EV Sales, EV Production, Charging Stations, EV Categories (Two-Wheelers, Cars, Buses, etc.), Government Incentives, and other related metrics.

🧹Data Cleaning:
Duplicate removal, handling missing values, renaming columns, and converting data types for consistency.

👨‍💻Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
◻️ Summarizing data with statistics, identifying trends through visualizations, and detecting outliers.

Visualization Techniques:
📈📉 Line Charts for time-series trends in EV sales and production. Bar Plots for comparing EV sales and production across states and categories. Pie Charts for proportional representation of EV categories.

Findings and Conclusion:
🚕 Identified key trends in EV adoption, leading states, and impact of government policies. Provided policy recommendations to boost EV adoption and infrastructure development. Suggestions for future research and deeper insights into the EV ecosystem.
